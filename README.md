Brave is developed on the popular open source engine from Google Chromium, which runs Chrome and many other modern browsers. Brave also used the Blink and JavaScript 8 rendering engine. For the iOS version of the browser, the open source WebKit engine, which forms the basis of Safari, was used.

The two main advantages of the Brave browser are: high speed of loading web pages and privacy, which prevents sites from collecting important information about users.

In terms of page loading speed, Brave bypasses the fastest browsers in the world: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Only Firefox Quantum is faster than it. Brave for mobile platforms loads web pages 8 times faster than Safari on iPhone and Chrome on Android. This speed is achieved mainly because the browser removes online ads and blocks user tracking, as a result of which the amount of downloaded content decreases sharply. At the same time, its performance remains the same, but not higher than leading browsers. Another advantage of the browser is its low resource consumption. For older and slower computers with weak hardware, Brave can be extremely useful.

On the main page you can see detailed statistics on how much advertising is blocked every day. You can configure the blocking mode or disable it both for a single site and for the browser as a whole.

Using the Brave browser, users remain anonymous on the network, blocking any attempts by advertisers to identify and collect information about them. The company claims that it does not store any user data on its servers. However, according to one of Brave’s creators, ex-Firefox co-founder Brendan Eich, data is stored outside of cloud storage by default. The company’s privacy statement states that Brave does not collect any user data, other than services for searching and forecasting pages.

A special Shields menu allows you to customize the lock as you wish. It is possible to disable blocking of scripts and tracking, cookies, enable device recognition and add forced connection of the HTTPS protocol. But anonymity will cost some convenience, for example, if you turn off the function of transmitting query data in search engines, then the forecasting service for searching and loading pages will be disabled.

It is noteworthy that the functions of the Tor browser are integrated in Brave, but with one difference: it does not allow you to view which nodes are used in the Tor repeater to which the device is connected and does not provide the same control over the connection.

The browser also effectively detects and blocks web pages with malicious code to prevent infection of the computer and keep personal information safe.

An unusual feature of the browser is blocking content from social networks embedded on other sites. Embedded messages from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are blocked. This is useful when you need to eliminate unnecessary distractions.
